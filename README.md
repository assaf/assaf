👏 Hey there, I’m Assaf.

👨‍💻 Without revealing my age, when I started programming, high resolution displays was 80 x 25 characters.

🏖 Right now I'm “inbetween startups“, just a fancy way of saying I do some freelance consulting/advising, while planning where to land next.

☕️ I blog at https://labnotes.org/ about software design and development, people and management, culture and technology. **[Feel free to subscribe](https://labnotes.org/)**.
